TshwaneBusMate Structure

Driver side and Passenger side websites stored in 'Public' nodejs file Structure
    This is so that the driver side can communicate with passenger side (tracking)

Depending on website side, either add new files to Driver folder (driver side website) or 
    Passenger (passenger side website), within the 'Public' file

Nodejs allows for communication between html files
To use nodejs on your own system you must have it installed on your system
