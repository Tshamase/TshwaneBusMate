how to run and track gps devices via web browser (like a real G)

1. ensure theres two devices (tracker and trackee)
2. activate nodejs (node server.js in the terminal)
2.1 ensure your system has nodejs and ngrok installed, also have an ngrok account to test youself :) 
3. run ngrok (ngrok http 3000)
4. change web socket link (wss) link in the "driver-map-and-gps.js" and/or test-trackedmap files to the ngrok provided link (...free.app)
5. run ngrok url for tracker to send out gps location (i.e ngrok-url/sunnyside-driver.html), 
    and trackee for receiving and displaying gps location (i.e ngrok-url/sunnyside-driver.html).
6. stalk your favourite tshwane bus driver hahahahaha 	(ㆆ _ ㆆ)
